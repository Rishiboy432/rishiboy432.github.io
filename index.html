  <h1>Internet & Website Development  </h1>
  <h3>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW): Explain how the web works, the role of the web servers, what are web browsers?</h3>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), or commonly known as The Web, is the leading information retrieval service of the Internet. The Web gives users an array of documents that are connected by the means of hypertext or hyperlinks according to what they search. Though, in order to process incoming network requests over different internet protocols, developers have created web servers. The primary role of web servers is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. All of this is done by web browsers which are software applications where users access the Web. When a user requests a certain website, the web browsers retrieve necessary content from the Webthe displays the search results on the user's device.</p>
  <h3>How is the World Wide Web different to the Internet?</h3>
  <p>The Internet is a global network of networks which are billions of electronic devices for the ability to access any information available, talk to others internationally, and many more. The WWW is a collection of information which is accessed via the internet.   </p>
  <h3>What is an Intranet? How does it relate to the Internet</h3>
  <p> Intranet is basically a restricted communications network or a private network that allows people to store, organize and share information within an organization. The intranet and internet are related in many ways. One main one is the fact that they are both networks which allows people to communicate, entertain and view information. The only difference is the fact that intranet is a private network whereas the internet is a public network service for anyone to access.</p>
  <h3>What is an Internet Protocol? compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP</h3>
  <p> Internet protocol is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet. Each host (computer) on the internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the internet. The 3 different types are:
<li> HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the way in which HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is transferred over the web. This protocol uses TCP/IP to manage web transmissions.
</li>
<li> FTP – File Transfer Protocol provides a method for copying and transferring files over a network from one computer to another.
</li>
<li>TCP/IP – Transmission Control Protocol and IP are 2 different procedures that are almost linked together. Linking of some protocols are common because the functions of different protocols can be complementary, they can carry out and complete different tasks this way.
